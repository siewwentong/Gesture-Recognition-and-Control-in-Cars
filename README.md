# Gesture-Recognition-and-Control-in-Cars

Distracted drivers cause nearly 4.5 million car crashes between 2010-2014. Our proposed idea is to introduce gesture recognition to control the auxiliary systems in cars. This is done using a 1D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor, that will detect gestures posted by the driver while driving. The response is simulated in an app interface. Its accuracy, efficiency and robustness under different situations is measured. Our prototype is able to accurately detect six static gestures, without being affected by the surrounding, such as lighting conditions and noises. Several future improvements for it to sustain in the market are also suggested in this report.
